Explain the entire java life cycle.


Life cycle of a java program tells us what happens right from the point when we type source code in a text editor to the point ,
that source code is converted into machine code (0’s and 1’s).

There are three main stages in the life cycle of a java program. They are:

Editing the program
Compiling the source code
Executing the byte code
First, you will start with typing the program in a text-editor
(ex: notepad, notepad++, wordpad, textedit etc). After completing editing of the program, we have to save the file.
While saving the file you should remember that the file must be saved with .java extension. For example, let’s think that
I had written a Java program which contains a single class Sample (more on classes in future posts).
It is a good convention to save the file with the name of the class. So, as per my example, the file will be saved as Sample.java.

Second step is compilation. The name of the Java compiler is javac.
The input to the compiler is Java source code which is available in Sample.java.
The output of the compiler is machine independent or platform independent code which is known as bytecode.
The file which is generated after compilation is .class file. As per my example, the bytecode file will be Sample.class.

Last step is execution. The bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed by Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
Input to the JVM is bytecode and output is machine code (0’s and 1’s) which will be executed by the CPU of the local machine.




what is class?
A class is a blue print for creating objects. that means that any code that is written should be under a class otherwise
it's not going to be executed.



What is object?
A Java object is a member (also called an instance) of a Java class.
Each object has an identity, a behavior and a state.


What is the entry point of an application?
In Java programs, the point from where the program starts its execution ,
or simply the entry point of Java programs is the main() method



Why main is static?

The main() method is static so that JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class.
This also saves the unnecessary wastage of memory which
would have been used by the object declared only for calling the main() method by the JVM.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?

the Object class is the superclass of all classes. It is the topmost class in the Java class hierarchy,
and all other classes are derived from it.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?

The PATH variable is used to tell the operating system where to look for executables (programs or commands) when we
enter them in the command prompt or terminal. It is a list of directories that are separated by a semicolon (on Windows)
or a colon (on macOS and Linux).

the CLASSPATH variable is used by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to locate class files when running Java programs.
It is a list of directories and JAR files that are separated by a semicolon (on Windows) or a colon (on macOS and Linux).


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?

Inheritance: An interface can be implemented (inherited) by a class using the implements keyword, while
an abstract class can be extended (inherited) by a subclass using the extends keyword.

Method implementation: An interface does not provide any implementation for the methods it defines,
while an abstract class can provide some implementation for the methods it defines.

Multiple inheritance: An interface can be implemented by multiple classes, while a class can only extend one abstract class.
This means that an interface allows for multiple inheritance, while a class does not.

Access modifiers: In an interface, all methods are implicitly public and abstract,
and all fields are implicitly public, static, and final. In an abstract class, methods and fields can have any access modifier.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?

we cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class
we have to implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract.

what is Access Specifier?

In object-oriented programming languages, an access specifier (also known as an access modifier) is a keyword
that is used to control the visibility and accessibility of class members (fields, methods, and constructors).

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming model that uses classes and objects.
there are four fundamental concepts of Object-oriented programming
– Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Data abstraction.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?

a package is a namespace that is used to organize classes and interfaces into a logical hierarchy.
Packages help to prevent naming conflicts between classes and interfaces with the same name,
and they provide a way to access the classes and interfaces of a library or framework.


Java compiler imports java.lang package internally by default.
It provides the fundamental classes that are necessary to design a basic Java program.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.

API stands for application programming interface, which is a set of definitions and protocols for building
and integrating application software.
Rest-assured , Postman , JMeter, Katalon-Studio


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
Java doesn’t support Multiple Inheritance

The problem occurs when there exist methods with the same signature in both the superclasses and subclass. On calling the method,
the compiler cannot determine which class method to be called and even on calling which class method gets the priority.


What is method overloading and when it happens?

Two or more methods can have the same name inside the same class if they accept different arguments.
This feature is known as method overloading. Method overloading is achieved by either: changing the number of arguments.
or changing the data type of arguments.



Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it?


Checked exceptions are those that are checked by the compiler at compile-time.
If a method throws a checked exception, the calling method must either handle
the exception using a try-catch block or declare that it throws the exception.


an unchecked exception is an exception that is not checked by the compiler at compile-time.
This means that the calling method is not required to handle or declare these exceptions.
try-catch blocks can be used to handle both checked and unchecked exceptions. However,it is
recommended to fix the problem at the source of an unchecked exception


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?

The static keyword is a non-access modifier used for methods and attributes.
Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?

The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods,
which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).




What is final, finally and finalize?
Final is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java.
Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling.
Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection.


What is a constructor ?

A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class,
is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
There can be multiple constructors in a class. However, the parameter list of the constructors should not be same


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?

If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor
called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?

"this" keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?

The super keyword is used to represent an instance of the parent class which is created implicitly for each object of the child class.
The super keyword can be used to invoke the parent class methods and constructors.
It can also be used to access the fields of the parent class.

What is JVM stand for ?
JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine

Is JVM platform independent?

JVM, is platform dependent because configuration of each OS differs.

What version of java are you using?

I'm using java 8


What is JAR stand for ?

JAR stands for Java Archive.


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?

The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (java),
a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc.
to complete the development of a Java Application.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?

JRE identifies all the helpful class libraries needed for execution, while JVM is a subclass of JRE
that decodes the bytecode into machine language and other minor tasks.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile-time is the time at which the source code is converted into an executable code while
the run time is the time at which the executable code is started running.

What is heap?
The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects instantiated by applications running on the JVM.


How java manage it's memory?
Java uses an automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
                      String                StringBuffer               StringBuilder

What is Singleton class?

singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.
This mechanism is used to persist the object


when to use transient variable in java?

Transient in Java is used to indicate that a field should not be part of the serialization process


Difference between while and do..while loop?

The difference between while and do while loop is that in the while loop the condition is checked prior to executing
any statements whereas in the case of do while loop, statements are run at least once, and then the condition is verified

What is Enum?

An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).

what is iterator?
An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?

int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store.
On other hand Integer is an object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value.

Why is String Immutable in Java?

The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
Constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.


The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?

The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple threads
that are used to speed up garbage collection.


What is JIT stands for?
JIT stands for Just In Time


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?

Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease
in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected.
During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
no we can not

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?

The major difference between Stack memory and heap memory is that the stack is used to store the order of method execution
and local variables while the heap memory stores the objects and it uses dynamic memory allocation and deallocation.

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?

Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself,
and manipulate internal properties of the program.

what is multithreading in java?

In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource.
In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent results.
The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads.

what is framework?
A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software applications.
☺

What are the testing Framework available in java?
selenium , Junit, TestNJ,SerenityBDD, Mockito


Difference between jUnit and testNG?

What are the dependencies for this project?

Dependencies in Maven are defined in the pom.xml file using the dependency tag.
Each dependency is defined by a group ID, an artifact ID, and a version.

mySQL, Mongodb, Junit,



what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency Injection in Java is a way to achieve Inversion of control (IoC) in our application
by moving objects binding from compile time to runtime.

What is static binding and dynamic binding?

The binding which can be resolved at compile time by the compiler is known as static or early binding.
The binding of all the static, private, and final methods is done at compile-time.

In Dynamic binding compiler doesn’t decide the method to be called. Overriding is a perfect example of dynamic binding.
In overriding both parent and child classes have same method .
